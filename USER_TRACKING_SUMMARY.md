# User Tracking Implementation Summary

This document outlines all the places where user tracking has been implemented to track who makes changes to orders, payments, and other data in the system.

## User Tracking Fields
For consistent tracking across all operations, the following fields are used:
- `created_by` / `modified_by` / `processed_by`: User ID
- `created_by_username` / `modified_by_username` / `processed_by_username`: Username
- `created_by_role` / `modified_by_role` / `processed_by_role`: User role

**Note**: Email addresses are explicitly excluded from tracking for privacy reasons.

## Implemented User Tracking

### 1. Order Creation and Editing
**File**: `src/pages/CreateOrderForm.js`
**Fields Added**:
- `created_by`: User ID
- `created_by_username`: Username
- `created_by_role`: User role
- `modified_by`: User ID (for edits)
- `modified_by_username`: Username (for edits)
- `modified_by_role`: User role (for edits)

**Triggers**: When creating new orders or editing existing orders

### 2. Order Status Updates
**File**: `src/components/ViewOrdersPage.js`
**Fields Added**:
- `modified_by`: User ID
- `modified_by_username`: Username
- `modified_by_role`: User role

**Triggers**: When changing order status (Pending → Accepted → Fulfilled, etc.)

### 3. Payment Processing
**File**: `src/components/ViewOrdersPage.js`
**Fields Added**:
- `processed_by`: User ID
- `processed_by_username`: Username
- `processed_by_role`: User role

**Triggers**: When processing payments or refunds through the payment modal

### 4. Menu Item Availability Changes
**File**: `src/components/ViewMenuPage.js`
**Fields Added**:
- `modified_by`: User ID
- `modified_by_username`: Username
- `modified_by_role`: User role

**Triggers**: When toggling menu item availability (available/unavailable)

## Implementation Details

### Data Source
All user tracking information is sourced from the `AuthContext` using the `useAuth()` hook:
```javascript
const { userData } = useAuth();
```

### Field Mapping
The user data fields are mapped as follows:
- `userData.id` or `userData.user_id` → tracking ID fields
- `userData.username` → tracking username fields
- `userData.role` or `userData.user_role` → tracking role fields

### API Integration
User tracking data is included in API requests as part of the request body for:
- POST requests (order creation)
- PATCH requests (order updates, status changes)
- PUT requests (menu item changes)

## Benefits

1. **Accountability**: Track who made what changes and when
2. **Audit Trail**: Maintain a complete history of modifications
3. **Quality Control**: Identify patterns in user behavior
4. **Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify the source of changes when issues arise
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track which users are most active in the system

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding user tracking to:
- Menu item creation/editing (if implemented)
- Delivery location management
- System configuration changes
- Bulk operations
- Data imports/exports
